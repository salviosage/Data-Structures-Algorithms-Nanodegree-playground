## Dutch National Flag Problem

In this problem, I have sort an array which consist of 0, 1, 2 only. So to complete it in linear time. I have first calculated the frequency of occurences of all the numbers then updated the input_list to sorted numbers with the help of frequencies.




# using  sort_013 function 
## time comlexity

The logic completes in a single traversal, which is of O(n log n)
## space comlexity
In place comparison and swapping was done in this algorithm. No additional space was required.

As a result, the space complexity if of O(n).

# using  sort_012 function 

Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(3)
